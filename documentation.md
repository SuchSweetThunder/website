- Structured for easy maintenance and future updates

## Components

### Navigation

The navigation component consists of a desktop menu and a mobile menu that appears on smaller screens. The mobile menu is toggled with the burger button.

```html
<header class="navbar">
    <!-- Navigation content -->
</header>
```

### Footer

The footer component is consistent across all pages and contains contact information, location details, and social media links.

```html
<footer class="footer">
    <!-- Footer content -->
</footer>
```

## JavaScript Functionality

The `common.js` file contains shared functionality used across the site:

- Mobile menu toggling
- Animation initialization
- Viewport detection for elements

## CSS Variables

CSS custom properties (variables) are used for consistent theming and easy maintenance:

```css
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --color-primary: #ff5005;
  --color-primary-2: #525eff;
  /* More variables... */
}
```

## Responsive Design

The website uses a mobile-first approach with breakpoints at:

- Mobile: Up to 479px
- Small tablets: Up to 767px
- Tablets: Up to 991px
- Medium screens: Up to 1200px
- Large screens: Up to 1600px

## Build and Deployment

To build the site for production:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the build script: `npm run build`
3. The optimized files will be in the `dist` directory

To run the site locally for development:

```
npm start
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Implementing a CSS preprocessor like Sass for more advanced styling capabilities
2. Adding a static site generator for more complex content management
3. Implementing lazy loading for images
4. Adding more interactive elements with JavaScript
5. Implementing a contact form with validation

## Maintenance Guidelines

When updating the site:

1. Follow the established CSS structure and naming conventions
2. Use semantic HTML elements
3. Test thoroughly across different devices and browsers
4. Maintain accessibility standards
5. Optimize new images before adding them to the site
